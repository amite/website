#Coundown to KO #21: Using Spreecast during Node Knockout

*This is the 21st in series of posts leading up [Node.js Knockout][1],
and covers using [Spreecast][] during to collaborate with your team and
share with other participants around the world.*

## What is [Spreecast][]?

Spreecast lets groups share video experiences in real time.
With Spreecast, you can broadcast your live video to the world,
pulling in viewers to share the experience when it suits you,
and dismissing them when they're done. It's a fun format for
sharing at event locations and an awesome new way for
Node.js Knockout teams to coordinate their coding.

For Node.js Knockout you will be able to sign up and get
exclusive early, pre-beta access to Spreecast and unlimited
live video during the competition. Spreecast is pre-beta and
working hard to squash bugs and tune user experience. We’d
love to hear feedback on any bugs or issues that you encounter.

## Using Spreecast

If you are joining a specific Spreecast, you can browse to it
from the homepage, enter the unique url or perform a search.
By entering a Spreecast’s page, you will be able to watch the
live session or replay the archive of a previously recorded event.
All Spreecasts are recorded for later viewing.

When a spreecast is live, you can interact in the Spreecast
in a number of ways.  First, you chat about the subject in the
large viewer chat window below the broadcast pane.  Second, you
can request to join the spreecast with your own video with the
click of a button.   You can also type in a question which the
host can then include in the Spreecast

We recommend that you download the most recent version of Adobe
Flash and use Safari or Chrome for your browser, if possible.
If you request to join with video, Adobe Flash will ask for permission
to capture from your webcam and microphone.  The host will then be
able to chat with you directly, view your preview and approve you
for Spreecasting.

## Host Your Own Spreecast

Once you’ve created an account, you are ready to host your own Spreecast.
Simply click on the green "Spreecast Now" button from the home page.
Give your Spreecast a name, accept the terms and conditions and hit the
"Begin Spreecast" button.  It is possible to add details about your
session first or add them later.  This will bring you to the Spreecast page.
Before you go live, Adobe Flash will ask you for permission to use your
camera and microphone.  Once you accept this, you'll see yourself in the
local preview in the lower left corner of the broadcast pane.

You can pass around the URL of this page to your teammates or use the email
button on the top of the page to get the word out.  The Facebook and Google+
links won’t work during our private beta as those sites can’t access the page,
but the Twitter link does work.

Now, you’re ready to get yourself on air!  On the right hand side of the Spreecast
pane are the controls you’ll need to moderate and produce the session.
You should see yourself at the top of the Spreecast queue.
Simply click and drag yourself into the broadcast pane in the center of the page
- where it says "Drop to Add Broadcaster" which will highlight when you are in
the right spot.  You'll now see yourself in the entire broadcast pane.
You can now hit "Start Spreecast" on the right, and you are live!

Hopefully by this point, your teammates are arriving onto the Spreecast page.
They should hit the "Join with Video" button to request to join the broadcast.
Once they do this, they’ll pop into your Spreecast queue on the right rail.
Here, you will be able to expand their entry to see a preview of their video
and chat directly with them.  You should click on the green check mark to
approve them, and then you can drag them into your Spreecast as well.
You can also hover over their thumbnail in the viewer bullpen below the
broadcast pane and promote them to broadcast or producer (it probably will
be nice for all of your teammates to be producer).

When you are done with a session, click on the red "On Air" button.
This ends the spreecast and brings you to the post event edit page where
you can select a thumbnail for the session and add additional information about it.
You can also deactivate the session if you need to (which essentially hides it
from everyone).

##Sharing and Tagging

Be sure to tag your Spreecast with "nodeknockout", so the Spreecast will show up in
[beta.spreecast.com/tags/nodeknockout](http://beta.spreecast.com/tags/nodeknockout).
When you create a new Spreecast, click on "Add Details" to add tags before starting.

##Feedback

There's a feedback link at the bottom of the page. We'd love to hear what you think.

Have fun Spreecasting!
