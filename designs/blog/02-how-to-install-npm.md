_This is the 2nd in series of posts leading up
[Node.js Knockout](http://nodeknockout.com), a brief intro to
[npm](http://npmjs.org)._

npm is the node.js package manager. It's what you should use to install
and maintain your project's dependencies.

Almost every other post in this "Countdown to KO" series will instruct
you to install packages via npm, so make sure to install it soon.

## Installing npm

To install npm in one command, you can do this:

    curl http://npmjs.org/install.sh | sh

Of course, if you're more paranoid than lazy, you can also get the
[latest code][1], check it all out, and when
you're happy there's nothing in there to pwn your machine, issue a `make
install` or `make dev`.

See the [npm readme][2] for additional installation options, including
being able to install without git or curl, and being able to install
with different permissions.

## Coming soon


In a future post, npm author and [Node.js Knockout judge][3] Isaac
Schlueter will give a more detailed overview some of the most useful
features of npm.
